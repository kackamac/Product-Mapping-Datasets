 Our traditional propel stick dispenser can be used directly on underarms or use fingertips to swipe the dispensed cream to apply Ã¢â‚¬Å“anywhere elseÃ¢â‚¬Â on your body. Our water-based formula won't stain your clothes and leaves no residue behind.
 
 Using a trace amount, the propel stick will offer 110 underarm applications (two armpits) or 220 Ã¢â‚¬Å“anywhere elseÃ¢â‚¬Â uses. A little goes a long way!
 
 WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that smell? ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the sweet smell of science! Our water based cream rubs in like a lotion, and because LumeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not like ordinary deodorant, it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t smell like ordinary deodorant. A natural, unexpected, fleeting scent leaves you smelling like nothing at all! Change is good when change is better, and people who use Lume are clinically proven to smell better longer!

Traditional deodorants simply mask or neutralize odor after it forms.Pair Lume Whole Body Deodorant for women with our Acidified Body Wash and Acidified Wipes, and you will be an odor free powerhouse from head to toe.About Lume:As a practicing OB/GYN with a deep understanding of women’s anatomy, body chemistry, and how detrimental body odor can be to confidence, Dr. Shannon Klingman had a suspicion that the common concern of odor below the belt was being overdiagnosed as Bacterial Vaginosis (BV). She discovered that the vagina is not usually to blame for day to day odor, and that women needed an external solution—not antibiotics or douches—to control external body odor in the right way.Kitchen-made prototypes turned into clinically backed, outrageously effective deodorant designed to go where no others dare—anywhere body odor exists. And so, the first Whole Body Deodorant with 72 hour odor control was born.CleanYour clear choice for clean.

Unlike most allergy pills, Flonase Sensimist relieves your most severe allergy symptoms, including sneezing, itchy nose, runny nose and itchy, watery eyes, plus nasal congestion. Flonase Sensimist is a 24 hour allergy relief medicine that contains fluticasone furoate, delivered with a patented bottle specially designed for a unique scent free and virtually drip free allergy nasal mist. This allergy medicine stops your body from overreacting to allergens all season long, outperforming a leading non-drowsy allergy pill.* Flonase Sensimist provides our most advanced spray technology with an ultra lightweight mist for 24-hour all-in-one allergy relief.



This non drowsy allergy relief medicine is formulated for adults and children 12 years of age and older. Before using this allergy medicine, blow your nose. Shake the bottle, prime it by spraying until a fine mist appears, then spray twice into each nostril one to two times daily as needed.



* Total nasal symptoms vs. single-ingredient 180 mg fexofenadine.HSA/FSA EligibleRestrictions apply; contact your insurance provider about plan allowances and requirements.

Just one easy to swallow Nexium 24HR capsule a day provides complete all day, all night protection from heartburn.(1) Part of a group of medications called proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), Nexium 24HR capsules contain a delayed release formula with esomeprazole magnesium to block acid at the source, turning your bodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s acid pumps from on to off for complete heartburn protection.(2) Like other PPIs, Nexium 24HR acid blocker capsules may take from 1 to 4 days to reach full effect, but relief lasts for 24 hours, letting you power through your day and sleep peacefully through the night without heartburn interruptions. Nexium 24HR is the number 1 selling OTC brand for frequent heartburn and the number 1 choice of doctors for their own frequent heartburn.(3) This package of Nexium capsules contains a 14-day course of treatment in one convenient box. Don't let heartburn pause the moment. Stop acid before it starts with Nexium 24HR.(1) Use as directed for 14 days to treat frequent heartburn. Nexium 24HR may take 1 to 4 days for full effect. (2) It's possible while taking Nexium 24HR. Use as directed for 14 days to treat frequent heartburn. Do not take for more than 14 days or more often than every 4 months unless directed by a doctor. Not for immediate relief.

Abundant research supports collagen supplementation for maintaining these tissues as we age*.
 
 PhysicianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Choice Collagen is hydrolyzed into small peptides to enhance its absorption and bioavailability to the skin and other tissues. We also include DigeSEBÃ¢â€žÂ¢, a patented blend of digestive enzymes to promote optimal digestion and utilization*.
 
 Improve Cellulite and Wrinkles. By enhancing the structure and elasticity of the extracellular matrix and promoting skin hydration, hydrolyzed collagen peptides have been shown to support a smoother and more resilient skin appearance*.
 
 Bioactive Collagen Peptides may also help strengthen nails by contributing to keratin synthesis. A clinical study providing 2.5 grams per day of specific collagen peptides demonstrated a 42% reduced frequency of broken nails*.
 
 Add a Healthy Morning Protein Boost. Since our collagen powder is odorless and flavorless, it can be blended into oatmeal, smoothies, shakes or coffee as a nutritious addition to your morning routine!
 
 
 Hydrolyzed Collagen: Collagen peptides stimulate skin cells to create healthy, new collagen. Collagen is a protein naturally found in your body that plays a critical role in your skinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s appearance. The structure of collagen can be damaged by natural aging, or too much UV exposure. Taking a bioavailable collagen supplement helps replace and rebuild damaged collagen for stronger, more resilient skin as you age*.
 DigeSEBÃ¢â€žÂ¢ Digestive Enzyme Blend: DigeSEBÃ¢â€žÂ¢ contains an array of enzymes to support overall digestion and promote greater breakdown of collagenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s peptide chains. Our unique Collagen formula offers one of the most bioavailable and effective products on the market.
