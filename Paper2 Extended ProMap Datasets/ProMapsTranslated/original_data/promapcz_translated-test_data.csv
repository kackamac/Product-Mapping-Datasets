Did you know that… …the first ever band to win the X-Factor TV show was a British girl band called Little Mix? It happened in 2011 in the UK and since then the band Little Mix has been rocking the charts all over the world. The first song released was a remake of Damien Rice's hit Cannonball. The song Black Magic became a mega-hit and stayed at the top of the UK charts for 3 weeks. British beauties already have 6 studio albums, the last one named Confetti was released in 2020. Just in 2020 they scored big with the song Sweet Melody, which we definitely recommend to put on the playlist and play Intezze in your headphones.

Full description","LG OLED TV Solves it all for you
The extremely smart α7 4K Gen4 AI processor takes care of perfectly clear sound and image at all times. All optimization is done automatically in the background using AI Picture and AI Sound, using deep learning algorithms. This makes the optimization process as fast and efficient as possible. Forget the complicated manual setting of individual parameters and let the smart processor solve it all for you. Smart ecosystem
The powerful processor is complemented by the tuned artificial intelligence of LG ThinQ AI. This brings not only a great deal of personalized content, but also the ability to voice control TV and smart home. Reliable voice assistants Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa help you with this. Home control is also available for Apple devices using HomeKit technology. LG's TV will quickly become the full-fledged hub of your home. A cutting-edge OLED panel and breathtaking HDR
LG B1 Series TVs feature a world-class OLED panel that delivers a fantastic image with as yet unknown brightness and sharpness. The TV also features an improved version of the high dynamic range Dolby Vision IQ standard. You'll enjoy even sharper and more realistic details than with conventional HDR formats. Endless contrast and perfect black The image stands out thanks to endless contrast and millions of self-illuminating pixels that create realistic colours, led by perfect black. Forget faded dark grey and enjoy an unprecedented game of lights and shadows. 100% great colours A 100% volume of colours, certified by the global testing agency Intertek, is also a great credit for the most realistic image. This allows you to see the image as it was truly intended. Playing without compromise
A set of technologies is ready for all players and players to take the gaming experience to a whole new level. The TV has FreeSync Premium technology and G-Sync Compatible certification – these two labels promise to minimize the jamming and tearing of the image, thus offering the most smooth gaming. There is also a Game Optimizer, with which you can easily set up and customize your games to your requirements. The icing on the cake is the lightning-fast response of 1 ms, which will make your movements perfectly synchronized with the on-screen action. So let's get to action! Gentle for your sight and nature
The OLED screen is designed to be gentle for your sight even during long-term viewing. The TV therefore has a certification guaranteeing a blink-free display with low blue light content. This makes viewing it no photobiological risk.
The TV is gentle not only for your sight, but also for nature. Compared to LED panels, LG's OLED panels are safer as they do not use rear backlight and contain less plastic and hazardous materials. The TV's environmental benefits were also recognised at the CES Innovation Awards 2021, where LG OLED won in the ecodesign and modern innovation category. Magic wand instead of controller
The Magic Remote controller has also been upgraded. It has an ergonomic shape for a comfortable grip and features a scroll wheel and a pointer function. With dedicated buttons for Netflix, Disney+ and Prime Video, you can easily get into the main menu of these popular services. The Google Assistant button activates the voice assistant function for a change. The real treat is that the controller supports NFC wireless technology. This allows you to use the Magic Tap function, which connects your phone to the TV just by tapping the controller. Magic function! A masterful colour palette
If you want to move your TV from time to time, there is nothing easier than using the special Gallery stand.* In addition to the practical function for easy moving of the TV, your home gets a touch of a painting studio. Bet you won't see such colours anywhere. *The stand is sold separately.

Hisense TVs adjust brightness and colour levels separately for each scene, giving you a more accurate image in areas with shadows, more detail in brightness, and more vivid colours overall.

Get ready to win
Game mode increases your chances of winning by significantly reducing input delays to 16 ms.

Completely absorbing sound DTS Studio Sound™ is an advanced surround sound solution that accurately extracts and distributes individual sounds into space.

Yes? Then you'll love listening to music with Honor Choice headphones. These stylish headphones feature finely tuned 7mm converters that produce amazingly clear vocals, strong bass and plotted centres throughout the frequency range. You'll appreciate them even if you're watching a video or playing a game. The sound is fully synchronised with the image and there's almost no delay due to reduced latency to 130 ms. Wireless beauties stripped of cable hides Connecting headphones to a music source with a cable is impractical, lengthy and annoying. Fortunately, the cork beauties are completely stripped of cable and paired with the music source via Bluetooth technology in a fast and stable 5.0 version with a signal range of 10m. If you've already paired the headphones with your smartphone, you don't have to bother pairing each time you use the headphones. The headphones connect automatically as soon as they're removed from the case. This way saves your time and saves the battery power of the headphones. Did you know that… …the successful English singer Ellie Goulding has been playing the clarinet for many years? But she grew tired of this musical instrument, saying it was quite boring if it wasn't played in an orchestra. In addition to the clarinet, Ellie can also play the guitar. She learned guitar strumming all by herself at the age of 14 and, wishing to be a rock star, started on an electric guitar. Only later did she succumb to the beauty of the sound of an acoustic guitar. If you like Ellie Goulding's soft voice, be sure to include on your playlist the hit song Burn, written for Ellie by One Republic frontman Ryan Tedder. This song was originally intended for Leona Lewis, but in the end it went to Ellie and it's more than good. Put it on your playlist on your mobile, have it played on Honor's headphones and enjoy Burn at full blast. Excellent handsfree headphones: Honor Choice If you make frequent phone calls, you'll appreciate the handsfree function that Honor Choice headphones have. The model works with Dual-mic technology, with two quality microphones in each headset, powered by digital signal processing. The microphones can identify what one side is saying and what is just ambient noise. With this ability, they effectively filter out unwanted noises and provide perfect conditions to conduct a call in full clarity even when you're in a busier environment. Directly on the headphones is a touch control that can instantly accept or terminate a call. Great endurance, great charging box and water resistance In addition to the microphones and converters, the Honor Choice headphones also have a 55mAh charging battery that guarantees the headphones' endurance for up to 6 hours on a single charge while listening to music. To charge the battery, the headphones need only to be placed in a beautiful charging box equipped with a 500mAh battery. The case fully charges the headphones 3 times, extending the operating time by another 18 hours.

Function BOOST The intensive suction or boost function allows an immediate transition to maximum exhaust power in case of an acute need to vent a larger concentration of vapours or odours. Touch control Touch control with LED backlight is extremely elegant and yet very practical, fast and accurate. Touch surfaces on glass or even on stainless steel are easy to maintain and 100% resistant to mechanical faults. Deferred shutdown The deferred exhaust end function allows you to set the exact shutdown time of the exhauster and thus, even at a low level of power, safely vent residual vapours and smells even after finishing the heat treatment of the food or simply clean and refresh the air in the premises where the food preparation for pleasant and undisturbed dining has taken place.

The Quantum Processor 4K is a modern and high-performance processor that takes care of effective image and sound enhancement.

Full description","4K in full swing
New TVs from LG's UP7500 series give you a fantastic experience in true 4K resolution, offering 4 times more pixels than Full HD. Enjoy a gorgeous image with master colours from the established and reliable LG brand. Breathtaking HDR
The TV features Active HDR, which includes standards for high dynamic HLG range and an improved HDR10 Pro version. You can thus look forward to an even sharper image with more striking detail. For a perfectly tuned brightness at all times, the AI brightness control function is ready to recognize the lighting conditions in the room and automatically adjust the image settings accordingly. Studio-like movies
Not only for film enthusiasts, there is a special FILMMAKER MODE mode – it deactivates all image smoothing, artificial refocusing and noise reduction for a change. You can thus be sure that you will see the films exactly as their creators intended, i.e. without any embellishment. Many famous directors have expressed their support for this mode, including James Cameron, Christopher Nolan and Martin Scorsese. Perfectly tuned image The quad-core 4K processor eliminates noise, providing a great image with dynamic colours and realistic contrast. Its great advantage is the 4K Upscaler, with which it cleverly fills in the missing pixels of lower-resolution images. You can look forward to a first-class image, whether you're watching the latest blockbuster or a movie for old-timers. Smart ecosystem
The powerful processor is complemented by the tuned artificial intelligence of LG's ThinQ AI. This brings not only a great deal of personalised content, but also the ability to voice TV as well as smart homes. Reliable voice assistants Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa help you with this. In short, LG's TV will quickly become the full-fledged hub of your home. Endless fun
Choose from a wide range of popular apps including Netflix, Apple TV and many more. Trust that you won't get bored with this amount of fun. Playing without compromise
Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM) technology is available for all players and players, promising to minimise image jamming and tearing. Playing will be absolutely smooth and your movements perfectly synchronised with your on-screen tuning. There's also a Game Optimizer, with which you can easily set up and customise your games to suit your requirements. The icing on the cake is the HGiG feature, which ensures you play with a perfect HDR image. So let's get to action! Absorbing surround sound
Ultra Surround technology turns integrated stereo speakers into a virtual seven-channel set-up. However, if you want to connect full-fledged wireless speakers to your TV, you'll appreciate the Bluetooth Surround Ready feature. A big advantage of the TV is the smart AI Sound technology, which automatically adjusts the sound and optimises it for the most immersive viewing experience. Magic Wand instead of a controller
The Magic Remote has also been upgraded. It has an ergonomic shape for a comfortable grip and also features a scrolling wheel and a pointer function. With dedicated buttons for Netflix, Disney+ and Prime Video, you can easily get into the main menu of these popular services. The Google Assistant button activates the voice assistant feature for a change. The real treat is that the controller supports NFC wireless technology. This lets you use the Magic Tap feature, which connects your phone to the TV just by tapping the controller. Magic feature!

Full description","The Frame – the magic of a gallery in your home A painting that lights up your home
Don't want to disrupt the fine-tuned décor of your home with an ordinary TV set? Choose The Frame, which is also a splendid painting. Its minimalist design captivates you with its slim profile, subtle curves and perfect adherence to the wall. Moreover, its design is not marred by unsightly wiring thanks to One Invisible Connection. The Frame captivates you by reproducing the finest artwork and your own photos, both on and off. Express yourself with a style that fits you
One of the key elements of the design is the new frame, which can also be easily changed – it's magnetic so you can simply remove it and re-click it. The choice is between a modern frame in white or brown or imitation wood, and a bevelled frame that is available in white or brick. Comes straight with a top wall bracket
The Frame comes with a high-end Slim Fit wall bracket. This allows you to hang the TV as an image, really close to the wall. But it also offers advanced positioning options, including adjusting the angle to hang The Frame on the wall exactly as you want. You can even hang it in height. 'Invisible' connecting cable included
Connect all accessories from game consoles to the soundbar to The Frame, without worrying about unsightly cables running from the sleek hanging frame. Just plug the accessories into the included external One Connect Box, which can be hidden out of sight, for example in a cabinet. Connect the TV module with the One Invisible Connection's ""invisible"" transparent cable, which can be up to 15 metres long (5m cable included). Private gallery in your home
Buy a ticket and head to a world-famous gallery… or simply switch your The Frame into a special Art Mode after watching the film – Art Mode and enjoy the best historic and modern images and photographs right at your home. Project your own content or visit the Art Store, a virtual art store where you can find more than 1,400 works of art. Whether you're in the mood for old masters or eccentric modern art, The Frame will always serve you perfectly. It cleverly switches on and adapts to ambient conditions
The Frame doesn't waste electricity by being on all the time. When you leave the room, it turns off to save energy. When you re-enter the room, a built-in motion sensor records it and instantly turns the screen on so you can enjoy a glimpse of your favourite work of art. The ambient lighting sensor then ensures that the brightness and colours match the conditions in the room to make the art look realistic and natural. It also displays your own works and photographs
The Mona Lisa may be of incalculable value to mankind, but for you personally, family photographs or images you've created by hand may be more valuable. Create your own collection of images from your mobile phone or flash drive on your TV. The built-in memory is even bigger than the previous generation - 16GB of space is available. Breathtaking image quality with Quantum Dot
Samsung has equipped The Frame with Quantum Dot technology to take care of the most powerful movie experiences. It brings 100% colour volume to your living room to bring out all the details, resulting in realistic colours that will engulf you. In addition, you can see the detailed image from any viewing angle. A cutting-edge processor with advanced artificial intelligence
Samsung's Quantum Processor 4K is not only powerful but also smart. Artificial intelligence analyses both image and sound and constantly adapts and refines them to give you the highest viewing experience. A smart controller powered by daylight
The Frame automatically detects connected devices so you can start using them immediately. Plus, you won't have to have ten controllers on the table – the One Remote takes care of at least the basic controls not only for the TV, but also for the connected accessories. Plus, it's smart to power through solar cells so you don't have to deal with eternal battery replacement.

Full description","Welcome the Future of TV Watching
Sony Bravia XR TVs are the first in the world to be equipped with a unique processor with cognitive intelligence. The Cognitive Processor XR is not only the brain of the TV itself, but similarly to the human brain, it also works – it analyzes several hundred thousand different elements, from which it then composes the most balanced and trustworthy image.
Its extraordinary intelligence is also appreciated when it comes to sound delivery. The Cognitive Processor XR is able to pinpoint where sound comes from and adapt it to make it as natural as possible for the human ear. This will make you feel as if you are part of the action on the screen. A package of technologies for an exceptional image
Along with the unique processor, the Sony developers have also prepared a set of XR Picture technologies that ensures perfect image in every situation. You can look forward to deep colours and plenty of detail with XR Contrast Booster 5, matching any image almost to 4K with XR 4K Upscaling, or smoother and clearer images in fast scenes with XR Motion Clarity. Forget the frequent manual adjustment of parameters and let the smart processor do all the work for you.
In addition, the TV also features a special Netflix Calibrated Mode for maximum viewing experience on your favourite streaming platform. The icing on the cake is the IMAX Enhanced certification, which guarantees faithful image and sound reproduction on IMAX content. Maximum tuned sound
Smart also deserves exceptional sound, which, like an image, adapts to you and your room. With Acoustic Auto Calibration, curtains or furniture, for example, will no longer absorb sound and thus distort it. At Sony, they thought that every room is different and you need to adapt the sound's rendering accordingly to make it as natural as possible. In addition, the TV will know where you're sitting and will recite the sound so that you don't miss out on any detail.
The XR Surround technology, which creates surround sound from the sides and in a vertical direction, adds to the great experience. It gives you the opportunity to enjoy fantastic 3D sound even without speakers mounted in the ceiling. All this is underlined by the integrated Dolby Atmos technology, which will transform your home into a professional cinema hall. Just say
The big advantage of Sony's smart TV is the voice control option. It gives you much faster and more convenient access to the desired content than you've been used to. In short, if you don't feel like typing and searching the menu, just say so.

Full description","Hisense ULED TV ULED The Hisense U7QF series Smart TV is the result of technological advances in hardware and software equipment. It features a high-end screen with Quantum Dot technology, which creates a rich palette of shades for the natural rendering of challenging scenes. The non-repeatable viewing experience is guaranteed by supporting the highest standard of Dolby Vision image dynamics and surround sound under the auspices of premium Dolby Atmos technology. This amazing image – it's ULED!
Years of honest hardware and software development and patenting have given rise to the ground-breaking Hisense ULED® technology, which takes the viewing experience to unforeseen heights. Hi-view Engine, Full Array Local Dimming and Wide Color Gamut work together to create the best contrast, colour, movement and detail from any source. Quantity of fascinating colours
Hisense ULED TVs use Quantum Dot technology to expand the colour range. The width of the spectral line of light emitted by quantum points is much narrower than the width of the spectrum from conventional materials. This means that the three primary colours - red, green and blue - are more clearly distinguishable compared to conventional TVs. As a result, colours that were too deep or intense for conventional TVs are now perfectly sharp and realistic on Hisense TVs with Quantum Dot Colour. Optimal image in every scene
Full Array Local Dimming technology, i.e. local dimming across the screen, enhances image contrast by controlling each backlight zone separately. U7QF series TVs feature up to 90 independent zones. Managing backlight across the screen leads to a uniformly optimised image with deeper black and brighter white. This makes the image more accurate and dynamic. Cinema-like experiences thanks to Dolby Vision
Dolby Vision technology is currently the most advanced and advanced HDR standard and is supported by the world's film producers. It offers a vivid and realistic image with up to 40 times brighter light and blacks that are 10 times darker than the standard image. The result is a refined and realistic image that makes you forget you're looking at the screen. Absorbing sound with Dolby Atmos
The Hisense ULED TV with Dolby Atmos support brings a groundbreaking immersive sound experience to your home, whether it's shows, games or live sports. Moving sound is a major advance in stereo and even spatial sound. You'll feel like you're in the middle of an action as the sounds of people, places, things and music come alive with breathtaking realism and move around the space. Every sitting in front of a TV will be an exceptionally immersive experience. Well, that's a fine-tuned operating system
The VIDAA U4.0 operating system transforms your TV into a smart multimedia hub with an intuitive and user-friendly environment. VIDAA offers access to a wide range of apps including the popular Netflix, YouTube, Prime Video, Red Bull TV or Voyo services, which feature extensive libraries of movies, series, documentaries or sports broadcasts. There are also features for playing multimedia and easy mirroring of mobile device content. Turn your mobile into a remote control
When you pair your TV with the Remote NOW mobile app (Android, iOS), you can replace the remote control with your smartphone. The app also allows you to mirror the content of your mobile phone directly onto the big screen of your TV, to enter text comfortably or to use your phone as a mouse for easier browsing. Get ready to win
Increase your chances of winning during smoother gaming sessions, which you will enjoy thanks to a shorter lag between input and on-screen responses. The input lag on Hisense TVs drops to 16 ms, which you'll appreciate especially for action, sports or racing games. Hi-View Enginge guarantees maximum image smoothness The patented Hi-View Engine technology guarantees faster graphics processing thanks to artificial intelligence. Adjusts internal settings in real time to optimize image quality and overall viewing experience. Using algorithms, processor performance is individually distributed, analyzed and adjusted for each scene according to the individual pixel properties.

Thanks to exclusively developed nanotechnology, LG's NanoCell TV uses special nanoparticles to help eliminate imperfections in the colour spectrum. You can look forward to accurate colours and a vivid image full of detail. Beautiful image from every angle
Fighting over who sits right in front of the TV is a thing of the past – the brilliant NanoCell panel with wide viewing angles and highly consistent colours promises to be a fantastic spectacle wherever you nest. Tune everything for you
The α7 Gen4 AI 4K smart processor takes care of precision sound and image at all times. It does all the optimisation automatically in the background using AI Picture and AI Sound, using deep learning algorithms. This makes the optimisation process as fast and efficient as possible. Forget the complex manual setting of individual parameters and let the smart processor fine-tune everything for you. Smart ecosystem
The powerful processor is complemented by the tuned artificial intelligence of LG's ThinQ AI. This brings with it not only a great deal of personalized content, but also the ability to voice control TV and smart home. Reliable voice assistants Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa help you do this. LG's TV will quickly become the full-fledged hub of your home. Endless fun
Choose from a wide range of popular apps like Netflix, Disney+, Apple TV, Amazon Prime and many more. Believe that you won't get bored with this amount of fun. Breathtaking HDR
The TV features an improved version of Dolby Vision IQ's high dynamic range standard, which allows you to enjoy even sharper and more realistic details than conventional HDR formats. Play without compromise
A set of technologies is available for all players, taking the gaming experience to a whole new level. The TV comes with FreeSync Premium and Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM) technologies, which promise to minimise jamming and tearing of the image, offering absolutely seamless gaming. There's also a Game Optimizer, with which you can easily set up and customise your games to suit your requirements. The icing on the cake is a lightning-fast response of 1 ms, making your movements perfectly synchronised with what's happening on the screen. So let's get to action! Soft on your eyesight
The NanoCell screen is designed to be gentle on your eyesight even for long-term viewing. So the TV comes with a certification that guarantees a blink-free, low-blue-light display. This makes viewing it no photobiological risk. Magic wand instead of a controller
The Magic Remote has also been upgraded. It has an ergonomic shape for a comfortable grip, and it also has a scroll wheel and a pointer function. With dedicated buttons for Netflix, Disney+ and Prime Video, you can easily get into the main menu of these popular services. The Google Assistant button activates the voice assistant function for a change. The real treat is that the controller supports NFC wireless technology. This allows you to use the Magic Tap function, which connects your phone to the TV just by tapping the controller. Magic function!

Full description","Welcome the Future of TV Watching
Sony Bravia XR TVs are the first in the world to be equipped with a unique processor with cognitive intelligence. The Cognitive Processor XR is not only the brain of the TV itself, but similarly to the human brain, it also works – it analyzes several hundred thousand different elements, from which it then composes the most balanced and trustworthy image.
Its extraordinary intelligence is also appreciated when it comes to sound delivery. The Cognitive Processor XR is able to pinpoint where sound comes from and customize it so that it feels as natural as possible to the human ear. This will make you feel as if you are directly part of the action on the screen. A package of technologies for exceptional image
Along with the unique processor, Sony's developers have also prepared a set of XR Picture technologies that ensures perfect image in every situation. You can enjoy deep colours and plenty of detail with the improved XR OLED Contrast PRO, matching any image almost to 4K with the XR 4K Upscaling feature, or smoother and clearer images in fast-paced scenes with XR Motion Clarity. Forget the frequent manual adjustment of parameters and let the smart processor do all the work for you.
In addition, the TV also features a special Netflix Calibrated Mode mode for maximum viewing experience on your favourite streaming platform. The icing on the cake is the IMAX Enhanced certification, which guarantees faithful reproduction of the image and sound of IMAX content. Maximum tuned sound
Smart also deserves exceptional sound, which, like an image, adapts to you and your room. With Acoustic Auto Calibration, it will no longer be the case that curtains or furniture, for example, absorb sound and thus distort it. At Sony, they thought that every room is different, and the sound's rendering needs to be adjusted accordingly to make it as natural as possible. In addition, the TV will know where you're sitting and deliver the sound so that you don't miss out on any detail.
The XR Surround technology, which creates surround sound from the sides and in a vertical direction, adds to the great experience. In addition, the TV's screen itself also functions as a speaker, and thanks to Acoustic Surface Audio+ technology, the sound comes directly from the centre of the screen. This gives you the opportunity to enjoy fantastic 3D sound even without the speakers mounted in the ceiling. All this is underlined by the integrated Dolby Atmos technology, which will transform your home into a professional cinema hall. Just say
A big advantage of Sony's smart TV is the hands-free voice control. This will get you to the desired content much faster and more conveniently than you've been used to. In short, if you don't want to write and search the menu, just say so.

Full description","4K in full swing
New TVs from LG's UP7500 series give you a fantastic experience in true 4K resolution, offering 4 times more pixels than Full HD. Enjoy a gorgeous image with master colours from the established and reliable LG brand. Breathtaking HDR
The TV features Active HDR, which includes standards for high dynamic HLG range and an improved HDR10 Pro version. You can thus look forward to an even sharper image with more striking detail. For a perfectly tuned brightness at all times, the AI brightness control function is ready to recognize the lighting conditions in the room and automatically adjust the image settings accordingly. Studio-like movies
Not only for film enthusiasts, there is a special FILMMAKER MODE mode – it deactivates all image smoothing, artificial refocusing and noise reduction for a change. You can thus be sure that you will see the films exactly as their creators intended, i.e. without any embellishment. Many famous directors have expressed their support for this mode, including James Cameron, Christopher Nolan and Martin Scorsese. Perfectly tuned image The quad-core 4K processor eliminates noise, providing a great image with dynamic colours and realistic contrast. Its great advantage is the 4K Upscaler, with which it cleverly fills in the missing pixels of lower-resolution images. You can look forward to a first-class image, whether you're watching the latest blockbuster or a movie for old-timers. Smart ecosystem
The powerful processor is complemented by the tuned artificial intelligence of LG's ThinQ AI. This brings not only a great deal of personalised content, but also the ability to voice TV as well as smart homes. Reliable voice assistants Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa help you with this. In short, LG's TV will quickly become the full-fledged hub of your home. Endless fun
Choose from a wide range of popular apps including Netflix, Apple TV and many more. Trust that you won't get bored with this amount of fun. Playing without compromise
Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM) technology is available for all players and players, promising to minimise image jamming and tearing. Playing will be absolutely smooth and your movements perfectly synchronised with your on-screen tuning. There's also a Game Optimizer, with which you can easily set up and customise your games to suit your requirements. The icing on the cake is the HGiG feature, which ensures you play with a perfect HDR image. So let's get to action! Absorbing surround sound
Ultra Surround technology turns integrated stereo speakers into a virtual seven-channel set-up. However, if you want to connect full-fledged wireless speakers to your TV, you'll appreciate the Bluetooth Surround Ready feature. A big advantage of the TV is the smart AI Sound technology, which automatically adjusts the sound and optimises it for the most immersive viewing experience. Magic Wand instead of a controller
The Magic Remote has also been upgraded. It has an ergonomic shape for a comfortable grip and also features a scrolling wheel and a pointer function. With dedicated buttons for Netflix, Disney+ and Prime Video, you can easily get into the main menu of these popular services. The Google Assistant button activates the voice assistant feature for a change. The real treat is that the controller supports NFC wireless technology. This lets you use the Magic Tap feature, which connects your phone to the TV just by tapping the controller. Magic feature!
The controller is sold separately.

The refrigerator continuously monitors the way you use it and controls the temperature to prevent the temperature from rising so that your food stays fresh and energy consumption is reduced.Ideal climate on each shelf The negatively charged ions generated by the device continuously renew the air to mimic the natural microclimate, creating an ideal environment for fresh food. The MultiFlow 360° ventilation system evenly distributes ionized air through 14 ventilation holes to maintain a constant temperature on each shelf. Fast freezing The FastFreeze function freezes food at -24°C to preserve most of the minerals. After about 2 days, the function automatically switches off and the temperature of the freezer compartment returns to its default setting. This protects already stored food and takes good care of the pieces you re-insert without losing any quality.

This smart processor controls advanced upscaling, which, together with Motion Xcelerator technology, ensures smooth and clean 4K image. Deep contrast for a more vivid image

Do you need to connect quickly to an external screen at your home office or distance learning? You can take advantage of the wireless connection of your PC, laptop or phone. You'll appreciate not only more space for your work, but also a resolution in which no detail escapes you. Practical and elegant design

Full description","Welcome the Future of TV Watching
Sony Bravia XR TVs are the first in the world to be equipped with a unique processor with cognitive intelligence. The Cognitive Processor XR is not only the brain of the TV itself, but similarly to the human brain, it also works – it analyzes several hundred thousand different elements, from which it then composes the most balanced and trustworthy image.
Its extraordinary intelligence is also appreciated when it comes to sound delivery. The Cognitive Processor XR is able to pinpoint where sound comes from and customize it so that it feels as natural to the human ear as possible. This will make you feel as if you are directly part of the action on the screen. A package of technologies for exceptional image
Along with the unique processor, Sony's developers have also prepared a set of XR Picture technologies that ensures perfect image in every situation. You can enjoy deep colours and plenty of detail with XR OLED Contrast, matching any image almost to 4K with XR 4K Upscaling, or smoother and clearer images in fast-paced scenes with XR Motion Clarity. Forget frequent manual parameter editing and let the smart processor do all the work for you.
In addition, the TV also features a special Netflix Calibrated Mode to maximise the experience of watching your favourite streaming platform. The icing on the cake is the IMAX Enhanced certification, which guarantees faithful image and sound reproduction with IMAX content. Maximum tuned sound
Smart also deserves exceptional sound, which, like an image, adapts to you and your room. With Acoustic Auto Calibration, curtains or furniture, for example, will no longer absorb sound and thus distort it. At Sony, they thought that every room is different, and you need to adapt the sound's rendering accordingly to make it as natural as possible. In addition, the TV will know where you're sitting and will recite the sound so that you don't miss out on any detail.
The XR Surround technology, which creates surround sound from the sides and in a vertical direction, adds to the great experience. In addition, the TV screen itself also acts as a speaker, and thanks to Acoustic Surface Audio+ technology, the sound comes directly from the centre of the screen. This gives you the opportunity to enjoy fantastic 3D sound even without speakers mounted in the ceiling. All this is underlined by the integrated Dolby Atmos technology, which will transform your home into a professional cinema room. Just say
The great advantage of Sony's smart TV is the voice control option. This will get you to your desired content much faster and more conveniently than you've been used to. In short, if you don't want to type and search the menu, just say so.

Did you know that… …one of the most influential guitarists of all time, Jimi Hendrix, was left-handed from birth, but his dad made him use his right hand? He even had to play the guitar, but as soon as his dad left, he immediately turned the guitar. As the first instrument ever, he got a ukulele, and this excited him so much that he bought a small spanish from a classmate for five dollars. If you admire Jimi's work, be sure to play the 1994 album Live At Woodstock into your Intezze headphones, which will send guitar fans into a frenzy.

Full description","Key Features Gorenje BO747A33WG Oven Shape HomeMade Plus PerfectGrill Double Heater Touch Control Module Catalytic Oven Cleaning Quick Preheat Catalytic Cleaning Gorenje's built-in oven BO747A33WG features a catalytic cleaning feature that makes maintenance of the oven easy. When the oven reaches a temperature of 85°C or more during baking, the catalytic panels automatically absorb fats and impurities. AquaClean The oven surface is covered with new enamel, which makes the steam cleaning feature significantly improved. Just pour half a litre of water into the baking tray and turn on the AquaClean feature after each baking. In 30 minutes, the cleaning results are visible on the surface of the entire oven. GentleClose The oven door closes with just a gentle touch and no sound. DynamiCooling effectively cools the exterior of the oven and prevents damage caused by high temperatures. After baking, the heat sensor cools the outer surface of the oven, which is particularly useful for pyrolytic cleaning. The HomeMade Plus Oven is roomier with an oval shape that mimics the shape of a traditional wood-fired oven. The special air circulation dynamics provide excellent conditions for professional baking on one sheet, or even more at the same time. The air is distributed more efficiently, reducing the occurrence of cold spots. The PerfectGrill Oven is equipped with a dual heating unit for even baking. The smaller body is intelligently placed inside the larger body, allowing for optimal heat distribution. The food is crispy on the outside while remaining juicy inside. The variable combination allows the bodies to be used separately and simultaneously. SilverMatte The inner surface of the oven is very important for its operation. SilverMatte is a very durable and solid material that can withstand extreme heat, even for pyrolytic cleaning at 500 °C. The triple inner coating promotes heat reflection and provides additional insulation. Without micro pores, the oven surface is resistant to high temperatures, microwaves and steam.

Ideal climate on each shelf The negatively charged ions generated by the device continuously renew the air to mimic the natural microclimate, creating an ideal environment for fresh food. The MultiFlow 360° ventilation system evenly distributes ionized air through 14 ventilation holes to keep the temperature constant on each shelf. Fast Freezing FastFreeze freezes food at -24°C to preserve most of the minerals.

New TVs from LG's Nano75 range offer fantastic experiences in true 4K resolution. First-class NanoCell panels help to complete a masterful image with stunningly realistic colours. Nano helpers for realistic colours
Thanks to exclusively developed nanotechnology, NanoCell TVs from LG use special nanoparticles to help eliminate imperfections in the colour spectrum. You can look forward to accurate colours and a vivid image full of detail. Perfectly tuned image The quad-core α5 AI 4K processor eliminates noise and takes care of a great image with dynamic colours and realistic contrast. Its great advantage is the 4K Upscaler, which cleverly fills the missing pixels in the image at lower resolutions. You can look forward to a first-class image at all times. Smart ecosystem
The powerful processor is complemented by the tuned artificial intelligence of LG's ThinQ AI. This brings not only a great deal of personalised content, but also the ability to voice control TVs as well as smart homes. Reliable voice assistants Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa help you with this. LG's TV will quickly become the full-fledged hub of your home. Endless entertainment
Choose from a wide range of popular apps like Netflix, Disney+, Apple TV, Amazon Prime and many more. Trust that you won't get bored with such a slice of entertainment. Breathtaking HDR
The TV features improved versions of the high dynamic range standards HDR10 Pro and HLG, allowing you to enjoy even sharper and more realistic details than conventional HDR formats. Studio-like films
Not only for film enthusiasts, there is a special FILMMAKER MODE mode – it deactivates all image smoothing, artificial sharpening and noise reduction for a change. You can be sure that you will see the films exactly as their creators intended, i.e. without any embellishment. Many famous directors have expressed support for this mode, including James Cameron, Christopher Nolan and Martin Scorsese. Playing without compromise
Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM) is available for all players and players, which promises to minimize image jamming and tearing. Playing will be absolutely smooth and your movements perfectly synchronized with the on-screen action. There's also a Game Optimizer, with which you can easily set up and customize your games to suit your requirements. So get in the action! Gentle to your vision
The NanoCell screen is designed to be gentle for your vision even during long-term viewing. The TV therefore has a certification guaranteeing a blink-free display with low blue light content. This makes viewing it no photobiological risk. Magic Wand instead of a controller
The Magic Remote has also been upgraded. It has an ergonomic shape for a comfortable grip, and it also has a scrolling wheel and a pointer function. With dedicated buttons for Netflix, Disney+ and Prime Video, you can easily access the main menu of these popular services. The Google Assistant button activates the voice assistant function for a change. The real treat is that the controller supports NFC wireless technology.

Full description","4K in full swing
New TVs from LG's UP7700 series give you a fantastic experience in true 4K resolution, offering 4 times more pixels than Full HD. Enjoy a gorgeous image with master colours from the established and reliable LG brand. Breathtaking HDR
The TV features Active HDR, which includes standards for high dynamic HLG range and an improved HDR10 Pro version. You can thus look forward to an even sharper image with more striking detail. For a perfectly tuned brightness at all times, the AI brightness control function is ready to detect lighting conditions in the room and automatically adjust the image settings accordingly. Studio-like films
Not only for film enthusiasts, there is a special FILMMAKER MODE mode – it deactivates all image smoothing, artificial refocusing and noise reduction for a change. You can be sure that you will see the films exactly as their creators intended, i.e. without any embellishment. Many famous directors have expressed their support for this mode, including James Cameron, Christopher Nolan and Martin Scorsese. Perfectly tuned image The quad-core 4K processor eliminates noise, providing a great image with dynamic colours and realistic contrast. Its great advantage is the 4K Upscaler, with which it cleverly fills in the missing pixels of lower-resolution images. You can look forward to a first-class image, whether you're watching the latest blockbuster or a movie for old-timers. Smart ecosystem
The powerful processor is complemented by the tuned artificial intelligence of LG's ThinQ AI. This brings not only a great deal of personalised content, but also the ability to voice TV as well as smart homes. Reliable voice assistants Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa help you with this. In short, LG's TV will quickly become the full-fledged hub of your home. Endless fun
Choose from a wide range of popular apps including Netflix, Apple TV and many more. Trust that you won't get bored with this amount of fun. Playing without compromise
Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM) technology is available for all players and players, promising to minimise image jamming and tearing. Playing will be absolutely smooth and your movements perfectly synchronised with your on-screen tuning. There's also a Game Optimizer, with which you can easily set up and customise your games to suit your requirements. The icing on the cake is the HGiG feature, which ensures you play with a perfect HDR image. So let's get to action! Absorbing surround sound
Ultra Surround technology turns integrated stereo speakers into a virtual seven-channel set-up. However, if you want to connect full-fledged wireless speakers to your TV, you'll appreciate the Bluetooth Surround Ready feature. A big advantage of the TV is the smart AI Sound technology, which automatically adjusts the sound and optimises it for the most immersive viewing experience. Magic Wand instead of a controller
The Magic Remote has also been upgraded. It has an ergonomic shape for a comfortable grip and also features a scrolling wheel and a pointer function. With dedicated buttons for Netflix, Disney+ and Prime Video, you can easily get into the main menu of these popular services. The Google Assistant button activates the voice assistant feature for a change. The real treat is that the controller supports NFC wireless technology. This lets you use the Magic Tap feature, which connects your phone to the TV just by tapping the controller. Magic Function!

He was not afraid to enter the field of modern classical music either and wrote and recorded the piano concerto Disarming Time – A Modern Piano Concerto.

Ultra-high 4K resolution offers 4 times more pixels than normal Full HD. You can look forward to a beautiful image filled with the finest details. It'll give you a pretty colourful image
The special PurColor image technology takes you to the centre of the action – it can render the most realistic and impressive colours with outstanding sharpness. This makes watching your TV a completely immersive experience. Reliable and powerful processor The powerful Crystal 4K processor guarantees optimum image in all circumstances. This smart processor controls advanced upscaling, which, together with Motion Xcelerator technology, ensures smooth and clean 4K image. Deep contrast for a more vivid image
Especially in night shots, you'll appreciate the high dynamic HDR range feature, which brings exceptional brightness to the panel and thus provides a huge range of colours even in the darkest scenes. Perfectly tuned to the soundbar
Don't let your TV's speakers go to waste when you plug in the soundbar. Thanks to Q-Symphony, the TV can still play sound when you plug in a compatible soundbar. Audio is perfectly synchronised, powerful and more spatial than if the accessory played itself. Share content with one touch
Mirroring movies or music from your mobile phone is now even easier thanks to the Tap View function. Just tap the TV lightly with your phone, and you can watch the content being played on the big screen in a flash. For work and entertainment
Do you need to connect quickly to an external screen at your home office or distance learning? You can take advantage of the wireless connection of your PC, laptop or phone. You'll appreciate not only more space for your work, but also a resolution in which no detail escapes you. Practical and elegant design
The Samsung AU7172 catches the eye with its almost frameless design, which makes it easier to focus on the image being watched.

Full description","Welcome the Future of TV Watching
Sony Bravia XR TVs are the first in the world to be equipped with a unique processor with cognitive intelligence. The Cognitive Processor XR is not only the brain of the TV itself, but similarly to the human brain, it also works – it analyzes several hundred thousand different elements, from which it then composes the most balanced and trustworthy image.
Its extraordinary intelligence is also appreciated when it comes to sound delivery. The Cognitive Processor XR is able to pinpoint where sound comes from and customize it so that it feels as natural to the human ear as possible. This will make you feel as if you are directly part of the action on the screen. A package of technologies for exceptional image
Along with the unique processor, Sony's developers have also prepared a set of XR Picture technologies that ensures perfect image in every situation. You can enjoy deep colours and plenty of detail with XR OLED Contrast, matching any image almost to 4K with XR 4K Upscaling, or smoother and clearer images in fast-paced scenes with XR Motion Clarity. Forget frequent manual parameter editing and let the smart processor do all the work for you.
In addition, the TV also features a special Netflix Calibrated Mode to maximise the experience of watching your favourite streaming platform. The icing on the cake is the IMAX Enhanced certification, which guarantees faithful image and sound reproduction with IMAX content. Maximum tuned sound
Smart also deserves exceptional sound, which, like an image, adapts to you and your room. With Acoustic Auto Calibration, curtains or furniture, for example, will no longer absorb sound and thus distort it. At Sony, they thought that every room is different, and you need to adapt the sound's rendering accordingly to make it as natural as possible. In addition, the TV will know where you're sitting and will recite the sound so that you don't miss out on any detail.
The XR Surround technology, which creates surround sound from the sides and in a vertical direction, adds to the great experience. In addition, the TV screen itself also acts as a speaker, and thanks to Acoustic Surface Audio+ technology, the sound comes directly from the centre of the screen. This gives you the opportunity to enjoy fantastic 3D sound without speakers mounted in the ceiling. All this is underlined by the integrated Dolby Atmos technology, which will transform your home into a professional cinema room. Just say
The great advantage of Sony's smart TV is the voice control option. This will get you to your desired content much faster and more conveniently than you've been used to. In short, if you don't want to type and search the menu, just say so.

Full description","4K in full swing
New TVs from LG's UP7500 series give you a fantastic experience in true 4K resolution, offering 4 times more pixels than Full HD. Enjoy a gorgeous image with master colours from the established and reliable LG brand. Breathtaking HDR
The TV features Active HDR, which includes standards for high dynamic HLG range and an improved HDR10 Pro version. You can thus look forward to an even sharper image with more striking detail. For a perfectly tuned brightness at all times, the AI brightness control function is ready to recognize the lighting conditions in the room and automatically adjust the image settings accordingly. Studio-like movies
Not only for film enthusiasts, there is a special FILMMAKER MODE mode – it deactivates all image smoothing, artificial refocusing and noise reduction for a change. You can thus be sure that you will see the films exactly as their creators intended, i.e. without any embellishment. Many famous directors have expressed their support for this mode, including James Cameron, Christopher Nolan and Martin Scorsese. Perfectly tuned image The quad-core 4K processor eliminates noise, providing a great image with dynamic colours and realistic contrast. Its great advantage is the 4K Upscaler, with which it cleverly fills in the missing pixels of lower-resolution images. You can look forward to a first-class image, whether you're watching the latest blockbuster or a movie for old-timers. Smart ecosystem
The powerful processor is complemented by the tuned artificial intelligence of LG's ThinQ AI. This brings not only a great deal of personalised content, but also the ability to voice TV as well as smart homes. Reliable voice assistants Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa help you with this. In short, LG's TV will quickly become the full-fledged hub of your home. Endless fun
Choose from a wide range of popular apps including Netflix, Apple TV and many more. Trust that you won't get bored with this amount of fun. Playing without compromise
Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM) technology is available for all players and players, promising to minimise image jamming and tearing. Playing will be absolutely smooth and your movements perfectly synchronised with your on-screen tuning. There's also a Game Optimizer, with which you can easily set up and customise your games to suit your requirements. The icing on the cake is the HGiG feature, which ensures you play with a perfect HDR image. So let's get to action! Absorbing surround sound
Ultra Surround technology turns integrated stereo speakers into a virtual seven-channel set-up. However, if you want to connect full-fledged wireless speakers to your TV, you'll appreciate the Bluetooth Surround Ready feature. A big advantage of the TV is the smart AI Sound technology, which automatically adjusts the sound and optimises it for the most immersive viewing experience. Magic Wand instead of a controller
The Magic Remote has also been upgraded. It has an ergonomic shape for a comfortable grip and also features a scrolling wheel and a pointer function. With dedicated buttons for Netflix, Disney+ and Prime Video, you can easily get into the main menu of these popular services. The Google Assistant button activates the voice assistant feature for a change. The real treat is that the controller supports NFC wireless technology. This lets you use the Magic Tap feature, which connects your phone to the TV just by tapping the controller. Magic feature!

Full description","Welcome the Future of TV Watching
Sony Bravia XR TVs are the first in the world to be equipped with a unique processor with cognitive intelligence. The Cognitive Processor XR is not only the brain of the TV itself, but similarly to the human brain, it also works – it analyzes several hundred thousand different elements, from which it then composes the most balanced and trustworthy image.
Its extraordinary intelligence is also appreciated when it comes to sound delivery. The Cognitive Processor XR is able to pinpoint where sound comes from and customize it so that it feels as natural to the human ear as possible. This will make you feel as if you are directly part of the action on the screen. A package of technologies for exceptional image
Along with the unique processor, Sony's developers have also prepared a set of XR Picture technologies that ensures perfect image in every situation. You can enjoy deep colours and plenty of detail with XR OLED Contrast, matching any image almost to 4K with XR 4K Upscaling, or smoother and clearer images in fast-paced scenes with XR Motion Clarity. Forget frequent manual parameter editing and let the smart processor do all the work for you.
In addition, the TV also features a special Netflix Calibrated Mode to maximise the experience of watching your favourite streaming platform. The icing on the cake is the IMAX Enhanced certification, which guarantees faithful image and sound reproduction with IMAX content. Maximum tuned sound
Smart also deserves exceptional sound, which, like an image, adapts to you and your room. With Acoustic Auto Calibration, curtains or furniture, for example, will no longer absorb sound and thus distort it. At Sony, they thought that every room is different, and you need to adapt the sound's rendering accordingly to make it as natural as possible. In addition, the TV will know where you're sitting and will recite the sound so that you don't miss out on any detail.
The XR Surround technology, which creates surround sound from the sides and in a vertical direction, adds to the great experience. In addition, the TV screen itself also acts as a speaker, and thanks to Acoustic Surface Audio+ technology, the sound comes directly from the centre of the screen. This gives you the opportunity to enjoy fantastic 3D sound even without speakers mounted in the ceiling. All this is underlined by the integrated Dolby Atmos technology, which will transform your home into a professional cinema room. Just say
The great advantage of Sony's smart TV is the voice control option. This will get you to your desired content much faster and more conveniently than you've been used to. In short, if you don't want to type and search the menu, just say so.

The product is localized for CZ","iPhone 12Top-of-the-line.With the fastest chip and 5G support. D-Day for all Apple fans is finally here. Tim Cook and his team unveiled the gorgeous iPhone 12, inspired by the iPhone 5 with its angular design. And the gear! You can look forward to an OLED display, durable Ceramic Shield glass, Apple's powerful A14 Bionic chip, MagSafe or dual camera. It all comes down to five colour finishes. Off Omit the OLED6.1"" Super Retina XDR display from LightBox. The new iPhone 12 features a 6.1"" Super Retina XDR display that offers a fine resolution of 2,532 × 1,170 pixels with a fineness of 460 pixels per inch. Its key benefits include HDR 10 and Dolby Vison support, a maximum brightness of 625 nits (in HDR up to 1,200) or a tremendous contrast ratio of 2,000,000:1. A specially developed glass called Ceramic Shield covers the entire front. Apple promises roughly 4 times drop resistance. Off Omit the Dual 12Mpx sensor from LightBox Camera. For the iPhone 12, Apple has prepared a dual camera with enhanced optics. The main wide-angle lens boasts f/1.6 luminosity, optical image stabilization and a seven-lens lens. The ultra-wide-angle camera then features f/2.4 aperture and 120° field of view. The increase in image quality is noticeable even under low lighting. The new camera captures 27% more light. This also applies to video shooting. And by the way, this is the first line of iPhones with Dolby Vision movie-quality video recording support. Off from LightBox MagSafeThe rear magnetic part.The array of magnets on the rear offers extremely interesting features. For example, the MagSafe charger can use wireless charging with speeds of up to 15 W. 5GMobile network faster than WiFi.The big revolution is the integrated 5G support, for which Apple uses its own low-power chip. This gives Apple full control of the technology. An interesting feature is Smart Data Mode with automatic switching between suitable networks. PrivacyiOS 14 protects you.Apple's iPhone 12 is equipped with Face ID facial recognition. Unlocking is fast and extremely safe.

Candy refrigerator LED lighting LED lighting inside the CMDDS 5144SHN saves 90% of energy. It has 50 times better visibility and 30 times longer lifetime compared to traditional lighting. The cool light from the LED fixture is completely without a warming effect.

The freezing power is indicated by the weight of fresh food, which can be frozen in 24 hours.

The Thomson UG6400 Smart TV combines a variety of features with Android TV support. You can enjoy 4K ULTRA HD image and timeless sleek design in an ultra-thin body. The Micro Dimming feature enhances image quality to enjoy higher brightness and contrast in 10-bit colour depth. 4K HDR perfectly displays even the finest details, enhancing your overall viewing experience of your favourite movie or concert. 4K HDR gives you 4 times the resolution of a Full HD TV, which you'll appreciate especially when watching Youtube videos or Netflix movies. Android TV offers countless interesting content to watch. In addition, you can download great games on Google Play, which you can then play on your TV with the ability to plug in a gamepad. 4K HDR or a unique viewing experience
Android TV Thomson UG6400 offers a great picture experience thanks to its high dynamic range (HDR), which works with much greater contrast and a wide range of colours within 4K Ultra HD with 3840×2160 pixels. You'll see the difference mainly in full detail viewing in dark and bright scenes. Even more detail thanks to Smart HDR SMART HDR pushes the image in Ultra HD even further than HDR by analysing scenes and optimising brightness, contrast and colours for each scene separately. This brings out much more detail for the best experience. SMART HDR can also take care of converting content that is shot in SDR, or standard dynamic range. This function converts the image into HDR, which can extract a wide range of colours from the content, as well as greatly optimising brightness and contrast. Artificial Intelligence – AI – is behind it all, ensuring you enjoy every detail. Micro Dimming for famously coloured images
Imagine a TV screen divided into about 100 independent zones, in which the brightness is then adjusted to bring out more detail. This makes the dark part of the scene really dark and the light really bright. Wins on points The Picture Performance Index is an internal index label that expresses the image quality based on a score. If you add up the total number of points in a Thomson UG6400 TV image, you get 1500 PPI. This value translates to support for HDR as well as the Micro Dimming function for optimising both contrast and brightness. Android TV – the never-ending range of apps and entertainment Android TV is synonymous with a new world of never-ending fun and excitement. The Google Play store offers a wide range of apps, games and entertainment content for both children and adults. Undoubtedly, the most popular Netflix and Youtube film and music channels can be found right in the basic TV menu, plus 4K HDR. With the MagiConnect app, you can connect other external devices to play your photos, videos and memories, not just from your phone. Passionate gamers will appreciate the chance to connect a gamepad to your TV. Thomson UG6400 has another surprise – it's the experienced and fast Google Assistant, which you control only with your voice. Your kids can do it, too; just say ""Youtube Mole"" and the fairy tale starts. This allows you to enjoy a little more deserved sleep on the weekend. Cinema on your TV
Decades ago, Dolby Laboratories developed a sound standard called Dolby Audio. Since then, it has expanded at cosmic speed mainly into cinema. Since its inception, Dolby Audio has been a guarantee of crystal-clear and surround sound, which you will now enjoy on Thomson UG4600. Experience unique cinematic moments in your home, taking you to the Moon or the Amazon Rainforest, for example. It's up to you. Timeless and elegant
The modern and timeless design of the Thompson UG6400 beautifies every interior. Let yourself be enchanted by its elegance and enjoy the possibilities offered by Android TV.

Full description","A beautifully crafted women's backpack to be used for day trips, hikes, or cycling. The Tempest backpacks are the women's variant of the legendary Osprey Talon backpacks. They are better adapted to the specifics of the female figure and provide better wearing comfort. The Tempest 24 sits very well on the back thanks to the AirScape™ back system and the comfortable BioStretch™ lumbar belt. So you can put it on without any worries even for more mobility-intensive activities such as long runs or quick climbs in the mountains. On the bike you will appreciate the flashing strap and the possibility to insert the water bag behind the back system, i.e. outside the main pocket. The complete versatility is crowned by the possibility of attaching an ice pick and the Stow-on-the-Go system for attaching trekking sticks while walking, without the need to remove the backpack. This series of backpacks stands out mainly due to its low weight, versatility and a large number of handy accessories.","[{""key"": ""Type of add-on"", ""value"": ""backpack""}, {""key"": ""Designation"", ""value"": ""Unisex""}]",2,3329,https://www.mall.cz/damske-znackove-tasky-kabelky/osprey-tempest-24-iii-aluminum-grey-wm-wl-100067155289,0,2_bags,close_nonmatch,"[""https://cdn.alza.cz/ImgW.ashx?fd=f4&cd=SPTosp614&i=1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.alza.cz/ImgW.ashx?fd=FotoAddOrig&cd=SPTosp614-01&i=1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.alza.cz/ImgW.ashx?fd=FotoAddOrig&cd=SPTosp614-02&i=1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.alza.cz/ImgW.ashx?fd=FotoAddOrig&cd=SPTosp614-03&i=1.jpg""]","[""https://i.cdn.nrholding.net/69689446/550/550"", ""https://i.cdn.nrholding.net/69689446/1000/1000""]"

Full description","4K in full swing
New TVs from LG's UP7700 series give you a fantastic experience in true 4K resolution, offering 4 times more pixels than Full HD. Enjoy a gorgeous image with master colours from the established and reliable LG brand. Breathtaking HDR
The TV features Active HDR, which includes standards for high dynamic HLG range and an improved HDR10 Pro version. You can thus look forward to an even sharper image with more striking detail. For a perfectly tuned brightness at all times, the AI brightness control function is ready to detect lighting conditions in the room and automatically adjust the image settings accordingly. Studio-like films
Not only for film enthusiasts, there is a special FILMMAKER MODE mode – it deactivates all image smoothing, artificial refocusing and noise reduction for a change. You can be sure that you will see the films exactly as their creators intended, i.e. without any embellishment. Many famous directors have expressed their support for this mode, including James Cameron, Christopher Nolan and Martin Scorsese. Perfectly tuned image The quad-core 4K processor eliminates noise, providing a great image with dynamic colours and realistic contrast. Its great advantage is the 4K Upscaler, with which it cleverly fills in the missing pixels of lower-resolution images. You can look forward to a first-class image, whether you're watching the latest blockbuster or a movie for old-timers. Smart ecosystem
The powerful processor is complemented by the tuned artificial intelligence of LG's ThinQ AI. This brings not only a great deal of personalised content, but also the ability to voice TV as well as smart homes. Reliable voice assistants Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa help you with this. In short, LG's TV will quickly become the full-fledged hub of your home. Endless fun
Choose from a wide range of popular apps including Netflix, Apple TV and many more. Trust that you won't get bored with this amount of fun. Playing without compromise
Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM) technology is available for all players and players, promising to minimise image jamming and tearing. Playing will be absolutely smooth and your movements perfectly synchronised with your on-screen tuning. There's also a Game Optimizer, with which you can easily set up and customise your games to suit your requirements. The icing on the cake is the HGiG feature, which ensures you play with a perfect HDR image. So let's get to action! Absorbing surround sound
Ultra Surround technology turns integrated stereo speakers into a virtual seven-channel set-up. However, if you want to connect full-fledged wireless speakers to your TV, you'll appreciate the Bluetooth Surround Ready feature. A big advantage of the TV is the smart AI Sound technology, which automatically adjusts the sound and optimises it for the most immersive viewing experience. Magic Wand instead of a controller
The Magic Remote has also been upgraded. It has an ergonomic shape for a comfortable grip and also features a scrolling wheel and a pointer function. With dedicated buttons for Netflix, Disney+ and Prime Video, you can easily get into the main menu of these popular services. The Google Assistant button activates the voice assistant function for a change. The real treat is that the controller supports NFC wireless technology. This lets you use the Magic Tap feature, which connects your phone to the TV just by tapping the controller. Magic Function!

Did you know that… …the music video for the song Heartbreaker by singer Mariah Carey and rapper Jay-Z has long ranked among the most expensive videos in the world? It cost a huge sum of $2.5 million to make. In the video, Mariah catches her boyfriend with another woman and there is a rift between the two women. The clip was heavily inspired by film hits such as Grease, Scarface and Dragon is Coming. The song itself received mixed reviews from critics, mainly complaining that it was nothing innovative. The song scored in the charts in 1999 and is still one of the top hits of American R&B diva Mariah. If you're looking for something pleasantly swinging, be sure to put the GoGEN song Heartbreaker into your headphones and get to know Mariah in a slightly different way than as the singer of the Christmas megahit All I Want For Christmas Is You.
