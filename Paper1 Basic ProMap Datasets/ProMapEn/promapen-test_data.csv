"Hamilton Beach Easy Reach Toaster Oven with Roll-Top Door, Convection, Black, 31126D","You wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find a design like the Hamilton Beach Easy Reach Toaster Oven with Roll-Top Door anywhere else. Its unique and large opening makes food easy to reach. And since the door opens above the oven, it frees up your countertop space in front. Best of all, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy to keep clean because food canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t spill on the door. Contoured dials are easy to grip and turn, making it simple to switch between bake, broil and toast settings.The stay-on setting is safer thanks to a stop mechanism that prevents the knob from being turned to stay-on by accident.Easy Access to Food.Sprinkle cheese on your pizza while itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s baking or safely grab toast in the very back without all the maneuvering. The roll-top door moves up and out of the way so you can have safe, easy access to your food before, during and after cooking.Easy Access to Countertop.The Easy Reach Toaster Oven door rolls up, not down, making it easy to move food directly to your plate when itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s done.Easy to Keep Clean.Melted cheeses, crumbs and juices are less likely to end up on the door because the door is never under the food rack, even when food is being removed or put into the oven. The roll-top door and the crumb tray are both removable for cleaning.Easy-to-Grip, Contoured Knobs.This toaster oven is the first of its kind to have an innovative design that makes grasping and turning the control dials easy for anyone. The timer knob includes a stop mechanism that makes the stay-on setting even safer.Front-Access Crumb TrayThe crumb tray easily slides out from the front of the toaster oven, instead of the bottom, making cleanup simple while keeping crumbs off the countertop.Fits a 9Ã¢â‚¬Â x 11Ã¢â‚¬Â Bake Pan, 12Ã¢â‚¬Â Pizza, or 6 Slices of ToastWith 4 settings and a spacious interior, the Hamilton Beach Easy Reach Toaster Oven can accommodate the foods your family makes most: after-school snacks, toast, frozen pizzas or homemade meals.ConvectionUnlike many other toaster ovens, this oven lets you choose between bake and convection. The bake function is great for making delicious cakes and desserts. Use convection for crisp, golden-brown pizza and for an evenly cooked, caramelized crust on baked goods. Convection provides more even cooking as the fan circulates heated air continuously around the food.

For this MacBook Pro, that foundation was flash. Because when you build a notebook around an all-flash architecture, not only is everything more durable, reliable, and battery efficient - everything is fast. Really, really fast.</li><li><b>Matching power for power</b><br />A long battery life is impressive for any notebook. But for a high-performance notebook with an ultra-high-resolution display, top-of-the-line processors and graphics, and a superslim design, it&apos;s absolutely remarkable. The built-in battery gives you up to 1000 full charge and discharge cycles. Which means you can put your MacBook Pro to sleep, and it&apos;ll come back on instantly - after a day, a week, or even a month.</li><li><b>Advanced speaker design</b><br />You haven&apos;t heard it all until you&apos;ve heard the speakers inside the MacBook Pro. For something so thin and light, the sound is huge. And with a wide dynamic range, optimal balance, and a crisp, expressive quality, these speakers might sound too good to be true. That&apos;s because they labored painstakingly over the design to maximize the quality of every decibel you hear.</li><li><b>They&apos;ll hear you loud and clear</b><br />Dual built-in microphones are great for when you want to be heard. If you&apos;re making a FaceTime call, for example, the microphones reduce background noise from behind the notebook. And when you use dictation, they create an adaptive audio beam that intelligently adjusts to detect your voice - instead of the noise around you.</li><li><b>A brighter way to work</b><br />Thin and light, this notebook is designed to go anywhere - including places with less-than-stellar lighting. A built-in sensor detects changes in ambient light and adjusts the keyboard brightness automatically. So you&apos;re never left in the dark.</li></ul></body>, <body><ul><li>More color and contrast, less glare</li><li>It makes quicker work of everything</li><li>Matching power for power</li><li>Advanced speaker design</li><li>They&apos;ll hear you loud and clear</li><li>A brighter way to work</li></ul></body> Assembled Product Dimensions (L x W x H) 12.80 x 8.90 x 1.00 Inches","Standing screen display size 13.3 Inches Processor 2.5 GHz core_i5 RAM 4 GB DDR3 Memory Speed 2.5 GHz Hard Drive 128 GB HDD Graphics Coprocessor Intel HD Graphics 4000 Chipset Brand Intel Card Description Integrated Wireless Type Bluetooth Average Battery Life (in hours) 7 Hours Brand Apple Series Macbook Pro Item model number MD101LL/A -RB Hardware Platform Mac Operating System Mac OS Item Weight 5.66 pounds Product Dimensions 6 x 4 x 8 inches Item Dimensions LxWxH 6 x 4 x 8 inches Color Silver Processor Brand Intel Number of Processors 2 Computer Memory Type DDR3 SDRAM Hard Drive Interface Unknown Power Source Battery Powered Batteries 1 Lithium Polymer batteries required.

"Physician's Choice Collagen Peptides Powder, Unflavored, 8.7 oz","Collagen is essentially the glue of the human body, representing approximately 70% of the dermal layer of our skin and a structural component of our muscles, joints, and cartilage. Abundant research supports collagen supplementation for maintaining these tissues as we age*.
 
 PhysicianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Choice Collagen is hydrolyzed into small peptides to enhance its absorption and bioavailability to the skin and other tissues. We also include DigeSEBÃ¢â€žÂ¢, a patented blend of digestive enzymes to promote optimal digestion and utilization*.
 
 Improve Cellulite and Wrinkles. By enhancing the structure and elasticity of the extracellular matrix and promoting skin hydration, hydrolyzed collagen peptides have been shown to support a smoother and more resilient skin appearance*.
 
 Bioactive Collagen Peptides may also help strengthen nails by contributing to keratin synthesis. A clinical study providing 2.5 grams per day of specific collagen peptides demonstrated a 42% reduced frequency of broken nails*.
 
 Add a Healthy Morning Protein Boost. Since our collagen powder is odorless and flavorless, it can be blended into oatmeal, smoothies, shakes or coffee as a nutritious addition to your morning routine!
 
 
 Hydrolyzed Collagen: Collagen peptides stimulate skin cells to create healthy, new collagen. Collagen is a protein naturally found in your body that plays a critical role in your skinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s appearance. The structure of collagen can be damaged by natural aging, or too much UV exposure. Taking a bioavailable collagen supplement helps replace and rebuild damaged collagen for stronger, more resilient skin as you age*.
 DigeSEBÃ¢â€žÂ¢ Digestive Enzyme Blend: DigeSEBÃ¢â€žÂ¢ contains an array of enzymes to support overall digestion and promote greater breakdown of collagenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s peptide chains. Our unique Collagen formula offers one of the most bioavailable and effective products on the market.
